## THEORY

Op-amp in open-loop configuration has limited application due to its enormous open-loop gain. Controlled gain can be achieved by taking a part of the output signal to the input through feedback.  
This is called a **Closed-Loop Configuration**.

The four basic types of closed-loop amplifier configurations are:
- Inverting amplifier  
- Non-inverting amplifier  
- Differential amplifier
- Instrumentation amplifier 

The entire configuration can operate with either AC or DC input.

### **Inverting Amplifier**

This is the most widely used op-amp configuration.  
The output voltage Vo  is fed back to the inverting input terminal through the  Rf - R1 network.  
The negative sign in gain indicates a **phase shift of 180°**.


Acl = -RF/R1

DESIGN:

Inverting amplifier:

A = -Rf/R1
Take  A = 10
Rf =10 R1
Choose R1 = 1kΩ, Rf=10kΩ

PROCEDURE:
Inverting amplifier:

1.	Select R1 as a constant value and choose a value of Rf.
2.	Connect the circuit as per as the circuit diagram.
3.	Apply the constant amplitude input voltage to the circuit.
4.	Measure the output voltage amplitude for different value of V1 from DSO.
5.	Calculate the practical Voltage for different value of V1 & compare it with theoretical output.
6.	Practical gain & theoretical voltage should be approximately equal.
7.	Plot the graph of the input wave versus output wave for any one practical case.

### **Non-Inverting Amplifier**

If the signal is applied to the non-inverting input terminal without inversion, it is called a **non-inverting amplifier**.  
Here, the output is fed back to the inverting terminal, and **no phase shift** occurs.


ACL = 1 + RF/R1

## DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER

A circuit that amplifies the **difference** between two input signals is called a **Differential Amplifier**.  
It is useful in instrumentation applications.  
If the two input signals are identical, the output is ideally **zero**.


A = Vo/{V2 - V1} = -Rf/R1
